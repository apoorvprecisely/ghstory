Our country is already getting divided on the basis of religion enough..\n\nLike in the first story.. the guy could have just said that his friend's gf was of a different religion and her parents didn't approve.. Her being Muslim could have been simply avoided.\nBut sure, if it's a main aspect of the story, then please do mention :)\n\n@Hoezaay please consider this",

I clicked for funsies and that day I completed 10 of your streams. It gave me utter joy! The banter, the leg pulling and your personalities were the perfect blend. In no time you were part of my weekly rituals. And sometimes the only day of the week that I felt better. It's been a amazing journey Hoezay, it feels like you and Suresh ji are a huge part of my life now and I owe my smiles and giggles to yall!!! I hope andwish the ghost streams do come back. Love , light and success to both of you. Miss you already",
